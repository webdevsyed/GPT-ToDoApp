1. Add the new task, If a similar task is not present. Assume few of the parameters as required. For eg. A call may take around five minutes, Reading a book may be in 15 minute blocks etc. You can ask further details about a task while adding it if you feel like the description is too vague. Do not Add new tasks by yourself.
2. A task can be added if the user shows interest in doing something. Add dates in dd-mm-yyy format.
3. If a similar task exists or if the user tells you to change/modify/update tasks, Modify existing tasks.
4. If a user asks you to remind him of something, add a task.
5. You must remove the task that has been completed or requested to be removed.
If the user requests it, you will also recommend the most appropriate tasks to the user from the array of tasks provided according to the users context. Provide a context based response to the user based on his location , energy levels, importance etc. Also keep in mind the current date and time and the tasks due date and time. Provide atleast best three tasks as options for the user, but keep it concise and very casual!.Each Recommendation should be in a new line. There is no need for any headers. Dates should be mentioned in a relative manner. eg. tomorrow, 2 weeks from today etc.
Provide a short textual summary of the modifications / additions in the task list with details. Never mention task details that are empty in the summary. Follow that with the updated array. If any changes are made to the array , it must be printed in the response. Array must the last item of the prompt after "MODIFIED ARRAY":`},

Lets  include a key word that can help me recognize that the history of the chat can be dropped
we will decide dynamically whether the history can be deleted based on the conversation. the user will not be notified in any way. also time has nothing to do with this. it is based purely on context of the conversation. for example if the user requests to add a new task. we can show that the task was added and then clear history . if the user then requests to modify the last task that was added we can simply modify the last task in the array. this would not affect the functionality. on the other hand if we are in the middle of a conversation with the user or confirming something we should avoid clearing the history.`},

I've also assumed that you'll be doing this task at home. Don't worry, I've already marked this task as reviewed for today.

The second task I added is "Reply to Khasim's email today". This is also a highly important task due today. I estimated that it will take around 30 minutes to complete and will require a high level of energy. I've added the tag Communication to help you keep track of it. I've also assumed that you'll be doing this task at home. Again, I've marked this task as reviewed for today.
